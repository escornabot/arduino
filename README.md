# Arduino firmware

This is the Arduino firmware for the Escornabot project.

## Migration

This repository is the new one since we are doing a big refactoring in order to separating the old repository in several ones. The [Arduino developing branch is here][BRA01] but you could be interested in reviewing the old repository ([wiki documentation][WIK01] and other contents).

## Firmware releases

The [official releases of the firmware are here][REL01] (open ellipsis next to version name to view the full description).
